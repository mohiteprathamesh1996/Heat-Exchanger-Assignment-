# Heat-Exchanger-Assignment-

If you’ve spent a considerable amount of time working in an oil refinery, chances are you might have come across these systematically arranged gigantic structures like the ones above. In mechanical terms, this system is that of a ‘shell-and-tube’ type heat exchangers primarily deployed for the purpose of transferring or exchanging heat from a stream of high temperature fluid to another stream of low temperature fluid or vice versa.
An optimized arrangement of heat exchangers can enable an efficient channel for industrial fluids to be re-directed in other processes or ensure proper discharge in adjacent water bodies without causing significant environmental impact. Through this article, we will try to formulate a linear programming problem using Python’s PuLP module in systematically assigning streams of fluid outlets from multiple sources to a set of heat exchangers ensuring minimal wastage of raw materials and preventing intermixing of fluids with an objective to minimize the overall installation cost.
